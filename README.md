# Probability
Some probability projects

The purpose of this project is to build a program that calculates a area behind a graph of a function, where this funcion is a 
desnity probability function

THe idea behind it is that when you increse the value of k(the number of division on the given interval) the value of the area(e.g 
probability) turns more accurate, but in the otherside we have some problems to show the graph istantly because of the high range of
the for loop in the graph calculation part.

I'm using the following libraries:

- Matplotlib
- Numpy

My future objective is to turn this program to be able to calculate the probability of any function and before it verify if the
function really is a density probability function
