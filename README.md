# Probability
A probability ptoject that alllows to visualize the method Rienman's method of aproximation of the integral.

The purpose of this project is to build a program that calculates a area behind a graph of a function, where this funcion is a 
density probability function

The idea behind it is that when you increse the value of k(the number of division on the given interval) the value of the area(e.g 
probability) turns more accurate, but in the otherside we have some problems to show the graph istantly because of the high range of
the for loop in the graph calculation part.

The project uses the following libraries:

- Matplotlib
- Numpy

A future objective is to turn this program to be able to calculate the probability of any function and before it verify if the
function really is a  probability density function
